                <p>In the wake of our current situation around the world, families and individuals everywhere are doing their best to prepare, stay busy at home when schools and work are closed, and keep their sanity without feeling the need to panic.&nbsp;
                    As we all face the hardships that have come with the uncertainty over the last few weeks, we would like to offer some helpful tips for ways to keep your family calm and prepared, as well as things to do at home with your family during
                    this time away from normalcy.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    First, let us look at the benefits and challenges of private swimming lessons. Private swim lessons are beneficial for many reasons. Your child can build a special, personal relationship with their instructor. Private lessons allow all the focus during
                    the duration of the class to be given to your child alone. Private swim lessons are a great option for kids that have a hard time staying focused in a group setting. When choosing private lessons, there are a few challenges to consider
                    as well. Private lessons are more expensive than group lessons. You are paying for that personalized experience, but the price is often double the cost of group lessons. Another challenge some may face is the isolation. Some children
                    will strive in a one-on-one setting, but others may perform better when they are surrounded by other kids of their same age. Overall, private lessons are curated to be more personal for your child’s specific needs than a group lesson.
                    They are a great option or parents looking to expedite their child’s learning experience.

                    Most kids all over California are currently home from school in the wake of the closures due to COVID-19. For a lot of parents, this means trying to get creative on ways to keep your kids busy, active, and motivated. One great resource we have found is
                    called “Cosmic Kids Yoga.” The creator, Jaime, uses YouTube as her platform to create a wide range of yoga videos for kids. Some of her yoga themes include Trolls, Frozen, Pokemon, Star Wars, and more! These videos are an incredible
                    resource to get your kids moving, releasing some energy from being inside all day. In addition to Cosmic Kids, Pinterest is another awesome platform to explore. When it comes to crafts for kids and educational experiences to try at
                    home, Pinterest is your one stop shop for hundreds of ideas to explore! Every Pinterest post has a step-by-step tutorial on how to complete the craft or task, using items you are most likely to already find at home. One more great
                    resource is our Premier Aquatics Instagram (@swimoc) and Facebook (Premier Aquatics) pages. In the wake of our facilities closing temporarily, we have been posting different swim lesson tips and tricks for you and your little ones
                    to practice at home in the bathtub. Follow along for more!
                </p>

                <p>In addition to resources given by your child’s school in particular, one great way to enhance education during this time is with “Duolingo.” Duolingo is an incredible online resource that you can access through an app on your phone or
                    directly from a web browser that makes learning a new language simple and fun! Duolingo incorporates games, lessons, rewards, and more into the learning experience, going far beyond the typical textbook way of learning a new language.
                    Aside from Duolingo, there are multiple different awesome online resources to explore for the purposes of learning a new language, teaching a new skill, reading new books, and much more.

                    Finally, and most importantly, during this time of social distancing and staying home, it is crucial to stay calm. We are all experiencing the daily changes and hiccups that are accompanying this global pandemic together. The single most important resource
                    to getting accurate information regarding COVID-19 and the updates that accompany it, can be found on the CDC website. Now is the time for everyone to support one another in any way possible. We, like many others, cannot wait to be
                    back in the pool with you, making a splash and getting back to our normal routines! With love, Premier Aquatics.
